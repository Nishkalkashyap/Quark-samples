# Quark samples
Sample Quark projects with ideas for taking them further.

## Getting Started
The first thing to do is to install Quark, if you haven't already. You can download it from [here.](https://quarkjs.io/download)

Once you've got that out of the way, clone the repository. If you're new to git, check out the guide to [cloning a repository.](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository)

```
git clone https://github.com/Nishkalkashyap/Quark-samples
```

Each folder in `examples` directory contains a different app with its own `README.md` file explaining what it does, how to run it, and how it could be improved.

And each folder in `libraries` directory contains a Quark sketch describing how to use various libraries and frameworks in Quark. e.g. using `React.js`, `Vue.js`, `Serialport` and `Electron`.
