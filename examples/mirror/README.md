# Mirror
Simple sketch that plays a video of the computer's camera at a maximized size like looking into a mirror. Includes an optional rainbow filter effect that uses CSS animations.

> Note: This project is inspired from [this electron sample app.](https://github.com/electron/simple-samples/tree/master/mirror)

## Getting started

- Clone this repository
- `cd examples/mirror`
- Open project file `mirror.qrk`, or build file `mirror.build.qrk` in Quark.

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other Quark API's.

- Add support for saving current image to a local `.png` file.
- Support drawing directly on the mirror using the mouse.
- Add more effect and filter options.
- Add zooming.
- Add keybinding to quickly open it.
