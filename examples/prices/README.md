## Getting started

- Clone this repository
- `cd examples/prices`
- `npm install`
- Open project file `prices.qrk`, or build file `prices.build.qrk` in Quark.

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other [Quark API's.](https://quarkjs.io/references/)

- Double-click commodity to open directly on https://stooq.com
- Add the price of platinum (`PL=F`) to the app.
- Export prices to a `.csv` file.
- Show percentage change in price.
- Show notifications when prices go above/below certain amounts.
