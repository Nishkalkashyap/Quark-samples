## Getting started

- Clone this repository
- `cd examples/hash`
- Upload sketch to the arduino.
- Open project file `hash.qrk`, or build file `hash.build.qrk` in Quark.

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other Quark API's.

- Add tooltips that show times in hours/days instead of milliseconds
- Support exporting CPU times to a comma-separated (.csv) file
- Support saving chart as PNG
- Support copying chart image to clipboard
- Add second chart of free vs. used memory
