# Hash
Simple sketch that shows the hash values of entered text using different algorithms.

> Note: This project is inspired from [this electron sample app.](https://github.com/electron/simple-samples/tree/master/hash)

## Getting started

- Clone this repository
- `cd examples/hash`
- Open project file `hash.qrk`, or build file `hash.build.qrk` in Quark.

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other [Quark API's.](https://quarkjs.io/references/)

- Make headings links that open to Wikipedia page for algorithm.
- Support dragging/dropping a file to hash onto the window.
- Support opening a file via a dialog to hash from the app's menu.
- Display time taken to compute each hash.
