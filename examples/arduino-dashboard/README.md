# Arduino Dashboard
Create a dashboard and a data logger for Arduino in javascript with [node-serialport](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serialport) library. __Under 250 lines of code!!__ üòÅ

## Features
__Serialport selector:__ A graphical user interface component that allows you to select the serialport for your Arduino.

__Dashboard:__ A dashboard that prints the real time values on the screen and also draws charts.

<!-- ## Using the sketch
- First upload the `arduino.ino` file to the arduino.
- Open the sketch 
- Now connect the dashboard to the arduino. Select the serialport of your arduino by pressing `ctrl+p`.
- Now, to use the data logger, open the [commands palette](https://quarkjs.io/guide/quark-ide.html#command-palette) by pressing `ctrl+shift+p`, and select `Datalogger: Start` command. This will start the data logger.
* To stop the data logger, open the commands palette and select command `Datalogger: Stop`. This will stop the data logger and open a save dialog. -->

## Getting started

- Clone this repository
- `cd examples/arduino-dashboard`
- Upload the `arduino.ino` file to the arduino.
- Open project file `arduino-dashboard.qrk` to edit project, or build file `arduino-dashboard.build.qrk` to run the project in Quark.

## Running the project
- Open the build file `arduino-dashboard.build.qrk` in Quark.
- Press `ctrl+p` and select the COM port of your arduino from the serial port selector.

</p>

- To start the data logger, open the [commands palette](https://quarkjs.io/guide/quark-ide.html#command-palette) by pressing `ctrl+shift+p`, and select `Datalogger: Start` command. You will see a notification on the bottom right of your screen if the logger was started.
- To stop the data logger, open the commands palette and select command `Datalogger: Stop`. This will open a save dialog where you can enter the path of the file where you want to save your data.

## Going further

Here are some ideas on how it can be improved using other [Quark API's.](https://quarkjs.io/references/)

- Add buttons on status bar to start or stop data logger.
- Convert the bar chart into a pie chart.
